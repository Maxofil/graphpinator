## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report security bugs by emailing the maintainer at peldax@gmail.com.

The maintainer will respond to your email as soon as he can, usually within 24 hours.
If the vulnerability is accepted, a bugfix will be released to all actively maintained versions.

Depending on the severity, GitHub security advisory or `roave/security-advisories` can be used to inform users about the important bugfix release.
